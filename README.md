# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using **regression-based machine learning techniques**. The model analyzes medical and health-related features to support early diagnosis and data-driven healthcare decisions.

## Objective
To build and evaluate regression models that accurately predict diabetes outcomes using patient health data.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Linear Regression (for analysis and comparison)

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as:
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Insulin  
- Age  

Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, feature scaling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook  

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection and Scaling  
4. Model Training using Regression Algorithms  
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix  

## Results
- Logistic Regression provided consistent and reliable performance.
- The model demonstrated good predictive capability on unseen data.

## Key Highlights
- Implemented **regression-based machine learning models** for healthcare prediction  
- Performed **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and EDA**  
- Evaluated models using standard **machine learning performance metrics**  
- Developed an end-to-end **machine learning pipeline**

## Future Scope
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- Cross-validation for improved robustness  
- Comparison with other machine learning algorithms
